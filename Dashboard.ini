; Dashboard.ini - for Tursi's OBD2 Dashboard program

[General]
; Enables OBD system. When disabled, the RPM and Speed values will
; still cycle for test purposes.
EnableOBD=1
; Device to read OBD from - this is a device name
OBDPort=COM1:

; These maximums can be tuned to adjust the scale of the graphs.
; Maximum speed is always in Kilometers/Hour, regardless of scale
SpeedMax=175
; Maximum RPM 
RPMMax=6750

; This switch globally enables or disables direct querying of bits on external ports
; for command input
EnableExternal=0

; Shutdown mode (0=Close, 1=Shutdown and Turn off machine)
ShutdownMode=0

; Which scale to use (updated on exit) - 0-km, 1=mph
ScaleMode=0

; Set to 1 to hide the mouse cursor
HideMouse=1

; Set to one and Dashboard will periodically scan for message boxes and automatically dismiss them
ScanForMsgBoxes=1

[External]
; External text file - when present, it's copied into the log, then deleted.
NoteFile = C:\Dashboard\SCWebCam.txt

; Path to WinAmp, if you would like to use it (it's handy to include the path to your music folder or playlist)
WinAmp = "C:\Program Files\WinAmp\WinAmp.exe C:\Sounds"
; Whether to run WinAmp in Shuffle mode (updated on exit)
WinAmpShuffle=1

; Path to audio mixer - normally sndvol32.exe is in the search path
Mixer = "SNDVOL32.EXE"

; Filename to write a copy of the log to - leave commented out to disable
;LogFile="C:\LOG.TXT"

;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Timeouts to the OBD query functions. You can increase these if you are seeing timeouts.
; All times are in 55ms ticks

[Timeouts]
; Sleep is how long the program will be inactive when resetting
Sleep = 40

; How long to wait for the chip to respond to a hello
Hello = 12

; How long to wait for the car to negotiate a session with the chip
ISO = 200

; How long to wait for an RPM response
RPM = 1

; How long to wait for a Speed response
Speed = 1

; How long to wait for a trouble code response
Trouble = 1

; How long to wait for the engine load response (note: not displayed right now)
Load = 1

; How long to wait for engine temp response (also not displayed right now)
Temp = 1

; External ports can be configured for the various commands to the system.
; The commands are: WinAmpNext, WinAmpPrev, WinAmpShuffle, WinAmpPlay, ScaleMode, Mixer, 
; Volume Up, Volume Down, Mute, Shutdown, KeyUp, KeyDown, KeyLeft, KeyRight, Select
; Within each command block, specify a port address, mask, and type. External inputs
; on the Parallel and Serial are easiest. Since WinXP blocks direct port access, you 
; will require a program like UserPort installed to open direct access to the ports
; before this will work (you'll get an error about a priviledged instruction otherwise)
; You can add the pin values together in the mask to represent a combination of pins.
; EnableExternal in general must also be set to '1'

;Base Address should be the PIO data if bidirectional and configured for it 
;Base Address+1 will give you the status/control pins, even if not bidirectional:
;	// for the control byte:
;	// 08 = !ERROR (pin 15)
;	// 16 = SELECTED (pin 13)
;	// 32 = PAPER OUT (pin 12)
;	// 64 = ACK (pin 10)
;	// 128= !BUSY (pin 11)
;It's possible to read the control pins on a serial port using the serial ports
;base address+6. Do NOT interfere with the OBD2 serial port!! (not tested)
;	// 16 = Clear to Send	 (Pin 5 on 25 pin, pin 8 on 9 pin)
;	// 32 = Data Set Ready (Pin 6 on both)
;	// 64 = Ring Indicator (Pin 22 on 25 pin, pin 9 on 9 pin)
;	// 128= Carrier Detect (Pin 8 on 25 pin, pin 1 on 9 pin)

; For example, I have WinAmp Next mapped to the Paper Out pin on my Thinkpad:

[WinAmpNext]
;; Note: Port is 0x3BC. Parallel control pins are at Port+1! 0x3BD = 957 decimal
;Port=957

;; The mask specifies which pin or combination of pins to detect!
;Mask=32

;; Types: 0 - low-to-high, 1 - high-to-low, 2 - any transition
;; My button is actually a toggle that changes state each press
;Type=2
